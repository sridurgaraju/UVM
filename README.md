## 🛠️ UVM Projects Repository  

This repository contains **Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) testbenches** for various communication protocols and other verification projects. These testbenches are designed to verify RTL implementations using **SystemVerilog and UVM** methodologies.  

## 🔍 Projects Overview  

- **SPI Testbench:** Implements a UVM-based verification environment for **Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)**. It includes a driver, monitor, scoreboard, and test sequences.  
- **I2C Testbench:** A UVM testbench to verify an **Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)** design, with configurable test scenarios.  
- **UART Testbench:** Covers **Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART)** protocol verification, ensuring correct data transmission and reception.  

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies  

- **Languages:** SystemVerilog, UVM  
- **Simulation Tools:** Cadence Xcelium / Synopsys VCS / Mentor QuestaSim / Xilinx Vivado (any simulator that supports UVM)  

## 📌 Future Additions  

- More UVM testbenches for **memory controllers, networking protocols, and SoC peripherals**.  
- Enhancements to existing projects with **self-checking mechanisms** and **functional coverage improvements**.

## 🔧 Setup & Running Tests  

To run any project, follow these steps:  

1. **Clone the repository** or download the required **design and testbench files**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sridurgaraju/UVM.git
   cd UVM/<project-folder>  # Navigate to the specific protocol directory
2. Alternatively, you can manually download the design and testbench files from the respective project folder.
3. Compile and run the testbench using your preferred simulation tool
