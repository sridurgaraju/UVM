## 🛠️ UVM Projects Repository  

This repository contains **Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) testbenches** for various communication protocols and other verification projects. These testbenches are designed to verify RTL implementations using **SystemVerilog and UVM** methodologies.  

## 🔍 Projects Overview  

- **SPI Testbench:** Implements a UVM-based verification environment for **Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)**. It includes a driver, monitor, scoreboard, and test sequences.  
- **I2C Testbench:** A UVM testbench to verify an **Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)** design, with configurable test scenarios.  
- **UART Testbench:** Covers **Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART)** protocol verification, ensuring correct data transmission and reception.  

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies  

- **Languages:** SystemVerilog, UVM  
- **Tools:** Cadence Xcelium / Synopsys VCS / Mentor QuestaSim / Xilinx Vivado (any simulator that supports UVM)  

## 📌 Future Additions  

- More UVM testbenches for **memory controllers, networking protocols, and SoC peripherals**.  
- Enhancements to existing projects with **self-checking mechanisms** and **functional coverage improvements**.
