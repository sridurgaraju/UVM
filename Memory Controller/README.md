# 🧠 Memory Controller with CSR Interface

## 🛠 What is this?

This project implements a **Memory Controller** hardware module in SystemVerilog along with a **UVM-based testbench** that uses **RAL (Register Abstraction Layer)** to access and verify register behavior.

The controller provides a **CSR (Control and Status Register)** interface to manage memory operations (like reads/writes).

Rather than interacting directly with the memory, users set values in registers — and the controller uses those values to perform operations.

---

## 🧩 Interface Overview

Communication with the memory controller is done using a **CSR interface**:

- `csr_wr_en`: Write Enable  
- `csr_rd_en`: Read Enable  
- `csr_addr`: Address of the register  
- `csr_wr_data`: Data to write  
- `csr_rd_data`: Data read back

## 🗂 Register Map

| Register Name   | Address | Purpose                               | Access     |
|-----------------|---------|----------------------------------------|------------|
| `mem_ctrl_reg`  | 0x00    | Start and select memory operation mode | Read/Write |
| `mem_status_reg`| 0x04    | Shows whether controller is busy       | Read-Only  |
| `mem_cfg_reg`   | 0x08    | Configure burst length and latency     | Read/Write |
| `mem_error_reg` | 0x0C    | Indicates errors                       | Read-Only  |
| `mem_id_reg`    | 0x10    | Controller ID (hardcoded)              | Read-Only  |

## 🛠 How Does It Work?

### ✅ Writing to a Register

To perform a write:
- Set `csr_wr_en = 1`
- Set `csr_addr` to the register address
- Set `csr_wr_data` to the value to write

Only writable registers will accept writes.  
Writing to read-only registers is ignored.

### 🔎 Reading a Register

To read from a register:
- Set `csr_rd_en = 1`
- Set `csr_addr` to the register address
- The value will appear on `csr_rd_data`

Invalid addresses return a default value: `0x00000000`.

## 🧮 Register Bit Descriptions

### 1. `mem_ctrl_reg` (0x00)
- **Bit [0]** → `start` bit: starts memory operation when set to `1`
- **Bits [4:1]** → `mode`: selects operation mode
  
### 2. `mem_cfg_reg` (0x08)
- **Bits [7:0]** → Burst Length
- **Bits [11:8]** → Latency

### 3. `mem_status_reg` (0x04)
- **Bit [0]** → `busy` bit  
  Indicates whether the controller is currently operating.

### 4. `mem_error_reg` (0x0C)
- **Bit [0]** → `error_flag`  
  Set to 1 if an error occurs during operation.

### 5. `mem_id_reg` (0x10)
- Hardcoded to `0x1234ABCD` to identify the memory controller.

## 🧪 UVM Testbench (RAL-Based)

This project uses a **UVM Register Abstraction Layer (RAL)** model to streamline and abstract register-level operations in the testbench.

### 🚀 UVM Features Used

- **Register Abstraction Layer (RAL):**
  - Abstracts memory-mapped register accesses.
  - Simplifies CSR programming and checking.
  - Includes `uvm_reg_block`, register models, and adapter.

- **Sequence and Sequencer Architecture:**
  - Enables modular and reusable test scenarios.
  - Includes standard and RAL-based sequences.

- **Scoreboard:**
  - Checks functional correctness of DUT output.
  - Compares expected vs actual data transactions.

- **Monitor:**
  - Passive component that observes bus transactions.
  - Used for coverage and functional checking.

- **Driver:**
  - Converts sequence items into pin-level activity on the interface.
  - Communicates with sequencer and DUT.

- **Coverage Collection:**
  - Collects functional coverage for stimulus and register access.
  - Currently under development.

- **Test and Environment Structure:**
  - Modular `env`, `test`, and config-driven architecture.
  - Promotes reuse across multiple testbenches or DUT variants.

These features together ensure maintainability, reusability, and thorough verification of the memory controller.

> 🔧 *Currently working on the coverage part of the testbench to ensure functional and register-level coverage is met.*

✔ Extend testbench to include **error injection and recovery scenarios**.  
✔ Integrate formal verification for protocol compliance.
